# Timescales in Stars

We can be fairly sure that we are in hydrostatic equilibrium in a star, because we can calculate the timescale for variations in the pressure in a star to propagate through its body. 

<!-- calculate this as the freefall time -->

<!-- then calculate this as the sound-crossing time 
- recall the speed of sound
- diameter of star over this
 -->
