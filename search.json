    "text": "Preface\nWe live around a star, the Sun. It is overwhelmingly the most important feature of our environment – too bright to look at! – and drives the dynamics of our climate, our economy, and our daily routine. We understand it in remarkable detail: we can measure its internal sounds and buoyancy waves as it rings like a bell, and using the science of helioseismology we can accurately reconstruct its physical properties almost all the way to the core. We can see its magnetised wind as the Southern Lights, and measure it quantitatively on satellites. We we can even measure neutrinos directly reaching us from the nuclear furnace at its core.\nMore broadly, stars are to astronomy what atoms are to chemistry: innumerable building blocks of a much larger universe of galaxies and cosmology. Each has remarkably simple physics, really parametrized to a very good approximation only by their mass and composition, and at higher order their rotation period; these physics are so simple and reliable that we can accurately model the spectra of whole galaxies in the distant universe just using laboratory physics and our understanding of stars nearby.\nAnalytic reasoning is usually good enough to get rough understanding of the important phenomena in stellar physics, usually as scaling relations - but these are usually only accurate to an order of magnitude or so, and real models require computer calculations. In this course we will attempt to do a bit of both.\nThis is a series of notes, aimed at a second-year undergraduate level, about how stars work: exploring their simplicity and complexity, assuming only a first year undergrad level of classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and thermal physics, and other physics that we will introduce ad hoc as we go along. These notes are based in part on the excellent lectures from which I originally learned as an undergraduate at Berkeley, by Eliot Quataert; on Peter Tuthill and Mike Ireland’s courses at Sydney; and on the PHYS2082 course developed at UQ by Holger Baumgardt, and by myself.\nThis book is compiled using Jupyter-Books, which allows us to include Python calculations in the text; I aim to make this available in the Open Astrophysics Library when it is in a mature state. We will follow the style guide of Edward Tufte, using margins for asides and illustrations to avoid interrupting the flow of the text.\nWe will use cgs units for most calculations in this text, except where otherwise noted.",

    "text": "1.1 The Equation of Hydrostatic Equilibrium\nConsider a thin shell of radius \\(r\\) (and surface area \\(A = 4\\pi r^2\\)), thickness \\(dr\\), and mass density \\(\\rho\\), enclosing a mass \\(M_r\\).\nThe mass of this shell is \\(M_\\text{shell} = \\rho A dr\\), and from Newton’s law of gravitation the magnitude of the gravitational force of the whole shell inwards is\n\\[\n\\frac{- G M_r M_\\text{shell}}{r^2}\n\\]\nSo now we can calculate the net force on this shell (and therefore acceleration \\(a\\)), and require the forces to be in balance:\n\\[\nF_\\text{net} = M_\\text{shell} a = P_\\text{below} \\cdot A - P_\\text{above} \\cdot A - \\frac{G M_r M_\\text{shell}}{r^2}\n\\]\nLetting \\(P_\\text{above} = P_\\text{below} + dP\\),\n\\[\nM_\\text{shell} a = a \\rho A dr = - A dP  - \\frac{G M_r M_\\text{shell}}{r^2}\n\\]\nand therefore rearranging, in equilibrium (\\(a = 0\\)) we have the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dr} = -\\rho \\frac{G M_r}{r^2}\n\\]\nThis is actually a very familiar equation that we encounter not just in first-year physics, but in everyday life. Nearly all the mass of the Earth is in its body, and only a bit less than a millionth in its atmosphere. So we can consider a situation where\n\\[\nr = R_{\\textcolor{NavyBlue}{\\oplus}} + \\textcolor{green}{z}\n\\]\nWe can now write this in familiar terms with the acceleration due to gravity as\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dh} = -\\rho \\cdot \\underbrace{\\frac{G M_r}{r^2}}_{{\\equiv g \\text{, constant}}}\n\\]\nIf we are dealing with an incompressible liquid like water, then \\(\\rho\\) is a constant and we simply have\n\\[\nP(z) = P_0 - \\rho g z\n\\]\nThings are different when your density depends on pressure. For an ideal gas, \\(P = n k_B T\\) and \\(\\rho = n \\textcolor{OliveGreen}{\\langle m \\rangle}\\) - so we have an equation of state that we can use to solve for the vertical structure of an \\(\\textcolor{orange}{\\text{isothermal}}\\) atmosphere:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{d}{dz} (n k_B T) &= - \\langle m \\rangle g n \\\\\n\\frac{dn}{dz} &= - \\frac{\\langle m \\rangle g}{k_B T} \\cdot N \\\\\nn &= n_0 \\exp{(- \\frac{\\langle m \\rangle g}{k_B T} z)} \\\\\nn &= n_0 \\exp{- z/\\textcolor{cyan}{h}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand we call \\(\\textcolor{cyan}{h}\\) the \\(\\textcolor{cyan}{\\text{scale height}}\\) in the atmosphere. Let’s calculate this for some interesting situations!\nFirst let’s try an isothermal Earth atmosphere:\nmol_earth = 28.964 * m_p # average molecular weight for earth's atmosphere\nT_earth = 300 # K; room temperature\ng_earth = 9.8 # m/s\n\nh = k_B * T_earth / mol_earth / g_earth\nThis scale height of 8.7 km is 1.4\\(\\,\\times 10^{-3} R_\\oplus\\); the atmosphere really is very thin and can be treated as plane-parallel. This scale height would mean that the air is 96% as dense at the top of the \\(\\textcolor{Maroon}{\\text{Q1 Tower}}\\), and 36% as dense at the summit of \\(\\textcolor{gray}{\\text{Mt Everest}}\\).\nNow let’s plug in some numbers for the Sun, using Python:\nm = 0.5 * m_p # kg\n# mean molecular weight for ionized hydrogen = \n# mean of electron & proton = m_p/2\n\ng = G * M_sun / R_sun**2\nh = k_B * Teff_sun / m / g\ngiving a gravity \\(g =\\) 28.0 Earth gravities, and a scale height of 5.0\\(\\,\\times 10^{-4}\\,R_\\odot\\). So we see that the solar atmosphere has a tiny scale height relative to the overall size of the Sun, and the plane-parallel approximation is even better than on Earth!",
